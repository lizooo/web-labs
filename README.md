Repository for 1-5 labs from web course on 3rd semester of iot program in NULP

# Description and requirements

## Lab1

Description: Create a landing page following the given design (Figma).
<br>
Requirements:
- Use of semantic tags ( <header, <nav, <ul, <footer, etc.) wherever is necessary 
- All fonts, colour palette, elements sizes must strictly match the design.
- Pixel perfect is also not required, BUT your website should visually match the design template (i.e. If the element is horizontally centred on the design, it should look centred on the website)
- All class names must not be meaningless (i.e. class=”myClass”) and should follow the same naming convention, preferably BEM, but you could come up with your own (just be consistent)
- Basic cross-browser support (website should look correctly on last versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
- For now, responsiveness is not required.
  
  
  ## Lab2
  
Description: Improve a landing page following the given design (same as previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.
<br>
Requirements:
- The website should be partly responsive: 
- Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens). 
- Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.
- The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens
- The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).
- Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS can’t be in just one-two files)
- All of the previous work requirements must be kept.


  ## Lab3
  
Description: In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website - View Page 
<br>
Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations): 
- Sort of your items option
- Search option 
- Count total amount of some of the field (e.g total price of all cars)

Requirements:
- Responsiveness absolutely not required.
- Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.


  ## Lab4
  
Description: In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages 
<br>
Requirements:
- Update/Delete operations are not required for this work
- Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).
  If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.
- Responsiveness absolutely not required.
- Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

  ## Lab5
  
Description: In the last part of working on the website you have to implement all Create/Read/Update/Delete operations which must be made via the corresponding HTTP methods in your REST API.
